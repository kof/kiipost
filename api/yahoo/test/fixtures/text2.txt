For many, internet access is a vital resource. However, vast, rural swaths of the world have no broadband internet access. One of Google's latest "moonshot" projects seeks to fill that gap with balloons. Called Project Loon, the plan is incredibly ambitious: it calls for a large network of "towers" in the sky that receive internet access from antennas on the ground in one location and beam internet down to rural homes below. Google has many challenges to overcome before Loon becomes a reality, but the team says it hopes to have a functioning service online by summer 2015. We'll be covering the company's progress here â€” stay tuned for all the updates.
